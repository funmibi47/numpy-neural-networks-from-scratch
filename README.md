#  Numpy Neural Network Projects

This repository contains beginner friendly neural network projects built entirely from scratch using NumPy. The goal is to understand the core concepts of forward propagation, backpropagation and weight updates, without using machine learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Each project includes clear explanations, inline calculations and visual structure to help deepen understanding.

##  Projects Included:

###  1. Product Price Prediction
Predicts the price of a product based on numerical features using a simple neural network with one hidden layer.

- Input: Number of features (e.g. cost, material rating)
- Output: Predicted price
- Layers: 1 hidden layer
- Loss: Mean Squared Error

###  2. Will the Student Pass?
Predicts whether a student will pass based on how many hours they studied and slept.

- Input: Hours studied, Hours slept
- Output: Binary (Pass or Fail)
- Layers: No hidden layer (single layer network)
- Loss: Binary Cross Entropy

###  3. Will the Customer Buy?
Predicts if a customer will make a purchase based on marketing interaction data.

- Input: Age, Estimated Salary
- Output: Binary classification (Buy or Not)
- Layers: 1 hidden layer
- Loss: Binary Cross Entropy
