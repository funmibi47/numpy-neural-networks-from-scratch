#  Customer Purchase Prediction

Used a simple NumPy based neural network to predict whether a customer will buy a product based on interaction features. 
This is a binary classification problem with sigmoid activation and binary cross entropy loss.

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Input
- Number of product views
- Time spent on product page

##  Output
- 0 (Won't buy) or 1 (Will buy)

##  Model
- One hidden layer
- Activation: Sigmoid
- Loss Function: Binary Cross Entropy
