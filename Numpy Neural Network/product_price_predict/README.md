#  Product Price Prediction

Built a basic neural network from scratch using NumPy to predict product prices based on size, number of bedrooms, and age of the product. Applied forward propagation, activation functions, and weight updates to learn patterns in data.

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Input
- Product Size (in square feet)
- Number of Bedrooms
- Age of Product (in years)

##  Output
- Predicted Price (continuous value)

##  Model
- No hidden layers
- Activation: ReLU & Sigmoid
- Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)

##  Files
- `product_price_predict.ipynb`: Main notebook with training and prediction logic
