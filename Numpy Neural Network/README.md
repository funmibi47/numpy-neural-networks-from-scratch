# Mini Neural Network from Scratch 

### 🎯 Goal:
Build a simple 1 layer neural network using NumPy to predict student exam performance.

### 📊 Input:
- Hours studied
- Hours slept

### ⚙️ Process:
1. Multiply input vector with weights (dot product)
2. Apply sigmoid activation
3. Output: predicted chance of passing

### 🧠 Math Concepts:
- Vectors: input + weights
- Dot Product: weighted sum
- Matrix Multiplication: hidden layers
- Sigmoid: non-linearity
- Loss (MSE): prediction error

### ✅ Example:
Input: [5 hours studied, 6 hours slept]  
Prediction: **0.92** -> High chance of passing

### 🧮 Tools:
- NumPy only
